rulesText=The goal is to line up a certain amount of tokens on the game grid. \
  The tokens always fall to the lowest cell of the columns they're played on. \
  Once one of the players lined up enough tokens, he wins the round and gets one point. \
  The first player that gets to the set score wins the game.
